"""Per-row top-k with a DeepSelect-shaped interface, over four backends.

aiter carries four per-row selectors, each fastest in a different corner and
none able to cover the whole domain:

    argmax   k=1 only, and a reduction rather than a selection: the row split
             across as many workgroups as it takes to fill the part. Owns k=1.
    small_k  one chunk per lane, so k <= wave_size, and a survivor buffer that
             grows with the row bound. Unbeatable on short rows and tiny k.
    plain    the C++/ASM radix selector. Bounded at k=2048. Scales with rows
             better than anything else, so it owns the wide-M middle.
    decode   a grid-wide radix select: histogram, reduce, gather. Owns the very
             wide rows at low row counts, and all of k=4096.
    stream   one workgroup per row, reading the row once. Owns the narrow rows
             and the large-M end of the wide ones.

`topk_select` picks between them. The parameter names, order and return shape
follow `deep_select.topk` so code written against DeepSelect ports across; where
this cannot honour DeepSelect's behaviour it raises rather than diverging
silently. The differences are listed on `topk_select` itself.

Ties: as in DeepSelect, no prefix index may be assumed by default. `plain` has
no tie order at all (measured: 40 equal scores, 8 places, a set that is neither
the lowest nor the highest); `small_k` resolves toward the larger column,
`decode` and `stream` toward the smaller. `tie=` narrows the backend set to
those that can promise a direction, which costs speed.

    ======================  ============  =========  =============================

                                                     read, which this path may not do
    ``idx_oob_fill_value``    2147483647  ``-1``     what the kernels write
    ``indices_type``          int64       int32      what the kernels emit
    ``input`` dtype           bf16/fp32   fp32       no bf16 backend
    ======================  ============  =========  =============================

    ``return_value`` also defaults the other way -- ``False`` here, ``True`` in
    DeepSelect -- and this one does not raise, since asking for the values back
    is still honoured. No backend produces the values: they are gathered from
    ``input`` afterwards, which is a separate kernel plus a compare and a select
    over ``[rows, topk]``, and it is pure overhead for the callers that only
    route on the indices. Measured at rows=1024, width=32768, topk=16: 39.8us of
    selection under 74.3us of call, so the gather and the buffers around it were
    most of the time spent. Pass ``return_value=True`` to get them.

    Args:
        input: ``[rows, width]`` float32, inner stride 1.
        topk: elements to select per row.
        sorted: sort the returned values descending. Done on the host.
        end: ``[rows]`` int32 exclusive right bound per row, DeepSelect's
            ``end``; this is each row's live length. Defaults to the full width.
        sorted_index: sort the returned indices ascending. Done on the host.
        output_idx: ``[rows, topk]`` int32 to write into; allocated if omitted.
        output_idx_offset: ``[rows]`` int32 added to every live index.
        return_value: gather the selected scores and return them. Off by
            default; see above. ``sorted`` still works without it -- the values
            are gathered to derive the order and then dropped.
        tie: ``None`` leaves which of several equal scores wins unspecified, as
            DeepSelect does, and lets every backend run. ``'low'`` and ``'high'``
            promise the smallest or largest column and restrict the backend set,
            which can cost up to 1.9x. Either implies ``deterministic``.
        deterministic: the *set* of selected columns is a function of the row
            alone -- the same input selects the same columns on every call, and a
            row selects the same columns wherever it sits in the batch. The order
            they are returned in is not promised, and does move between calls:
            the streaming selector takes its output slots from a shared counter,
            so a row with more ties at the cut than places permutes. Pass
            ``sorted=True`` or ``sorted_index=True`` if the returned tensor
            itself has to be reproducible, not just its contents.

            Weaker than ``tie`` and cheaper than it: it only excludes ``plain``,
            keeping the small-k selector that ``tie='low'`` has to give up. Costs
            up to 1.9x where ``plain`` would have won.

    Returns:
