A hand-written Triton 2-D convolution library optimized for AMD RDNA
GPUs. Six kernel families (1×1, direct NCHW 3×3, 3×3 cblocked, 3×3
NHWC, Winograd F(4×4, 3×3), general) behind one shape-driven router and one entry
point. Drop-in for the forward path of `nn.Conv2d`.

---

## Why this op exists

PyTorch on AMD goes through MIOpen, which ships hand-tuned solvers per
architecture, per dtype, per layout. That works well on the combinations
the solvers were specifically tuned for, but every new dtype × layout ×
architecture combination needs its own tuning pass — so coverage is
uneven across the matrix (e.g. on RDNA4 the fp16 path is well-served,
while bf16 falls back to direct/GEMM solvers that are noticeably slower
at large channel counts; most modern checkpoints — LLMs, diffusion VAEs
— ship in bf16).

This op takes the opposite approach: a single set of Triton kernels
that runs **fp16 and bf16 through the same code path**, supports
**both NCHW and NHWC end-to-end** (channels-last inputs stay channels-last;
an ordinary contiguous input requested with `layout="nhwc"` is converted once),
and gets reasonable performance across the
full matrix **without per-architecture kernel implementations** (one
set of Triton kernels for every arch, with a thin per-arch JSON config
layer — see Tuning). A shape-driven
router picks between six kernel families so the right kernel runs per layer
automatically. Weight transforms are LRU-cached. Tuned NCHW 3×3 activations
can be read directly; other eligible shapes use one fused Triton NCHWc pack.

---

## Performance

Designed to deliver strong throughput on AMD RDNA4 across both fp16 and
bf16. The bench harness logs which MIOpen solver was selected per layer
and reports aggregate TFLOPS for both backends, so you can verify the
behavior on your stack.

To measure on your stack:

```bash
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv2d \
    --model <resnet50|"stable-diffusion-3.5-medium"|"FLUX.2-klein-9B"> \
    --dtype <fp16|bf16> \
    [--miopen-solvers]   # opt-in; ~60-120s upfront subprocess
```

The bench harness produces three box-drawn tables: LAYER-BY-LAYER (per-layer
Triton vs MIOpen TFLOPS, Triton kernel name, optionally MIOpen solver,
kernel+repack column for shapes that prepack), MIOpen SOLVER SUMMARY (only
with `--miopen-solvers`), and OVERALL PERFORMANCE (mean/median/aggregate
TFLOPS, total time, layer wins, correctness).

> **Note on TFLOPS**: numbers are *direct-convolution-equivalent* throughput
> (the standard convention used by cuDNN, MIOpen, and the Winograd
> literature), applied identically to both backends. Winograd kernels —
> Triton's F(4×4, 3×3) and MIOpen's F(2×2, 3×3) / Fury alike — execute
> fewer literal hardware MACs than this denominator counts (≈4× fewer for
> F(4,3), ≈2.25× for F(2,3)). The comparison is apples-to-apples.

## Quick start

### Use the function directly

```python
import torch
from aiter.ops.triton.conv.conv2d import conv2d

x = torch.randn(4, 256, 56, 56, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)
w = torch.randn(512, 256, 3, 3, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)

y = conv2d(
    x, w, bias=None,
    stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1), dilation=(1, 1),
    activation="relu",          # "none" | "relu" | "relu6" | "gelu"
    layout="nchw",              # "nchw" or "nhwc"
)
```

A shape-driven router picks one of six kernel families:

| Family | When it runs |
|---|---|
| 1×1 GEMM | `R==1, S==1` |
| Direct NCHW 3×3 | Tuned NCHW shapes selected by a crossover or exact-route table; no input repack |
| 3×3 cblocked (NCHW) | Eligible NCHW shapes not routed direct; uses a fused NCHWc pack |
| 3×3 NHWC | 3×3 with channels-last input — no input repack |
| Winograd F(4×4, 3×3) | Eligible non-wave32 targets where transforms amortize |
| General | non-1×1/3×3 and narrow-channel NCHW 3×3 |

### Use as `nn.Conv2d` drop-in

The kernel families above are functional; wrapping them in an `nn.Module`
(walk a model, swap each `nn.Conv2d` for a Triton-backed module that
calls `conv2d(...)` in its `forward`) works as expected and produces
images visually indistinguishable from the PyTorch / MIOpen reference.

Pixel-level agreement on FLUX.2-klein-9B (50 diffusion steps, same prompt
and seed under both backends, only VAE convs swapped to Triton): max diff
**6 / 255**, mean diff **0.17 / 255**.

---

## Constraints

- Only `groups=1` is implemented; callers must send depthwise or grouped
  convolutions to another backend.
- Only zero padding is implemented. The height and width pad amounts may
  differ, for example `(0, 2)`, but callers must send `"reflect"`,
  `"replicate"`, and `"circular"` padding modes to PyTorch/MIOpen.
- Inputs must be `fp16` or `bf16`.
- Forward only (no backward / training).

## Reproducing the tests and benchmarks

Run from the AITER repo root (`/app/aiter` in this tree, or `PYTHONPATH=/app/aiter`).

### Correctness (CI-collected; skipped on unsupported archs)

```bash
pytest op_tests/triton_tests/conv/                                # full matrix, 81 tests
pytest op_tests/triton_tests/conv/ -k "no_bias and fp16_nchw"     # subset
pytest op_tests/triton_tests/conv/ -k "test_edge"                 # one test family
```

Tests are parametrized over `(dtype, layout, method)`. Every kernel in
`_helpers.ORDERED_METHODS` is exercised against fp16 and bf16 on NCHW.
NHWC is single-dispatch (only `conv2d_nhwc`), so each NHWC test runs once
per dtype.

### Benchmark

Three modes, all in `bench_conv2d.py`.

**Single shape** (one parseable result line — for ad-hoc measurements):

```bash
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv2d \
    --N 1 --C 64 --H 56 --W 56 --K 64 --R 3 --S 3 --pad-h 1 --pad-w 1
```

**Real-model sweep** (default — uses ResNet50 if no `--model` given):

```bash
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv2d --dtype fp16              # default = resnet50
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv2d --model resnet50
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv2d --model "FLUX.2-klein-9B" --miopen-solvers
```

**Edge-case smoke sweep** (degenerate paths: `C=1`, dilation>1, asymmetric dims —
NOT representative of production):

```bash
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv2d --dtype fp16 --smoke
```

Cross-axis flags:

```
--dtype {fp16,bf16}                           # default fp16
--layout {nchw,nhwc}                          # default nchw
--method {auto,default,cblocked,nhwc,winograd_f4x3,winograd_f4x3_cblocked}
--metric {time,throughput}                    # default throughput
--no-bias                                     # bench the bias=None code path
--miopen-solvers                              # detect MIOpen solver names (sweep mode; ~60-120s subprocess)
--show-kernel-name                            # include routed kernel name in single-shape output
```

Real-model shapes are pre-extracted into `conv_shapes.json` (no
torchvision/diffusers needed at bench time). Each conv layer's
`(N, C, H, W, K, R, S, stride, pad, dilation)` was captured offline once per
model via forward hooks, deduped, and frozen there. To add a new model, append
a `"<ModelName>": {"conv2d": [...]}` entry to `conv_shapes.json` with the same
shape-dict fields.

**Why the layer count in JSON is smaller than the model's name suggests.**
An entry in `conv_shapes.json` is a *unique convolution shape*, not a physical
layer. The extractor walks every `nn.Conv2d` in the model, records its
`(N, C, H, W, K, R, S, stride, pad, dilation)` tuple, and dedupes — identical
tuples collapse to one entry. So the count reflects distinct kernel *work
items*, which is what the bench actually needs to measure (kernel TFLOPS is a
function of shape, so benchmarking the same shape twice adds nothing).

The gap is large because model names count *all* layers (conv + linear + norm +
…), while the JSON holds only *conv* layers, and only the *distinct-shaped*
ones. "ResNet-50" means ~50 weight layers total; of those, 53 are convs, but
they collapse to **23 unique shapes** (15 × 1×1, 7 × 3×3, 1 × 7×7) because the
network stacks many identically-shaped bottleneck blocks (e.g. all three 256→64
1×1 reductions in `layer1` share one shape). The bench iterates the 23; the
per-layer table therefore has 23 rows, one per unique shape.

Tested on ROCm 7.2 / PyTorch `2.9.1+gitff65f5b` / Triton 3.7 (commit `23f4e522d`).

### Tuning

Per-kernel configs ship as JSON in the nested config tree, one `DEFAULT.json`
per `(arch, kernel)` under `aiter/ops/triton/configs/<arch>/triton/conv/` —
e.g. `gfx1201/triton/conv/conv_3x3_nhwc/DEFAULT.json` and
`gfx1201/triton/conv/conv_prepack/DEFAULT.json`. The loader walks four tiers:
layout-specific shape pin → generic shape pin → `M_LEQ_x` bucket → `"any"`
fallback. No runtime autotune in the hot path, so CI compile time stays
predictable and the first call hits no tuning tax.

Conv config trees ship for gfx1100, gfx1151, gfx1200, gfx1201 and gfx1250 on
the RDNA side, and for gfx942 and gfx950 on CDNA. The optional direct-NCHW
table exists for gfx1100, gfx1151, and gfx1201. gfx1100
and gfx1151 use exact-shape routing, so shapes not measured faster than the
complete NCHWc path remain on the cblocked fallback; gfx1201 uses the
configurable spatial crossover.

Retuning is an offline development workflow. Candidate search spaces and the
tuning driver live outside the production package; only the resulting JSON
files are shipped with the kernels.
