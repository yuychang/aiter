# AITER Triton Ops — Maintainer Guide

This directory contains all Triton- and Gluon-based kernels and their Python
wrappers used by AITER. This README documents the conventions that every
change under `aiter/ops/triton/` is expected to follow. For anything touching
the tuned-config JSON tree, **`configs/CLAUDE.md` is the authoritative
rulebook** — this README summarizes it; that file wins on any conflict.

PR reviews under this directory are additionally checked by Copilot against
`.github/instructions/aiter-ops-triton.instructions.md`, which encodes the
rules below. Any cleanup or refactor that changes a convention must update
both that file and this README in the same PR, so the two stay current.

```

Public wrapper modules live in the categorized folders; the kernel bodies live
in `_triton_kernels/` at the same relative category path, or in
`_gluon_kernels/<arch>/` at the same relative category path when the Gluon
implementation is architecture-specific.
Tests mirror the same categories under `op_tests/triton_tests/<category>/`.
Kernel bodies are internal: tests, benchmarks, and external code call the
public wrappers only — never `_triton_kernels/` / `_gluon_kernels/` directly.

Legacy flat imports (`from aiter.ops.triton.gemm_a16w16 import ...`) still
resolve through `_BACKWARD_COMPAT_MAP` in `__init__.py`, but **new code must
import from the categorized path** (`aiter.ops.triton.gemm.basic.gemm_a16w16`).

## Framework portability — what may import `torch`

`utils/_triton/` is the torch-free half of the shared machinery. The split
exists so the Triton kernels and their tuned configs can be imported — or
snapshotted into another repo — by a framework that is not PyTorch. The live
case is JAX-Triton (ROCm-supported), where the tensors are created by JAX and
handed to the same `@triton.jit` kernel.

| Layer | May import `torch`? |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| `utils/_triton/` — arch info, `kernel_repr`, pid preprocessing, kernel-side helpers | **No** |
| Config loading (`utils/config_utils.py`, the `*_config_utils.py` family modules) and `configs/*.json` | **No** |
| Kernel modules under `_triton_kernels/` and `_gluon_kernels/` | **No** for new modules — a jit body cannot call torch anyway; keep host-side allocation and dtype glue in the wrapper. Modules that already import torch are grandfathered. |
| `utils/` torch helpers (`shuffle.py`, `types.py`, `common_utils.py`, ...) and every public wrapper | **Yes** — this is where torch belongs |

- A helper both sides need is split, not duplicated: the torch-free part under
  `utils/_triton/`, the torch part in `utils/`. `moe_common.py` exists in both
  places for exactly this reason.
- `utils/_triton/tuning/` is exempt — those are standalone tuning harnesses
  that run in a PyTorch environment, not part of the importable surface.
- Non-PyTorch users still write their own wrappers. Their framework creates
  the tensors, so allocation, dtype and layout checks, and the launch belong
  to them; what crosses the boundary from AITER is the kernel plus its tuned
  config, not the wrapper.

## Tuned configs

### One layout, one path builder

Every tuned JSON file lives in a single nested tree, keyed by architecture,
backend, op and config family:

```text
configs/<arch>/<backend>/<op>/<d_type>/DEFAULT.json
configs/<arch>/<backend>/<op>/<d_type>/<CONFIG_NAME>-<suffix>.json
#        gfx950   triton    gemm  gemm_afp4wfp4
#        gfx1250  gluon     moe   a8w4
```

`<op>` is one of `gemm`, `moe`, `conv`, `mhc`, `attention`, `gmm`, `fusions`.
The flat, arch-prefixed directories (`configs/gemm/`, `configs/moe/`,
`configs/conv/`, the loose files at the top of `configs/`) and the fallback
code that reached them are gone.

Rules that follow from the layout:

- `<d_type>` is `config_name.lower().replace("-", "_")` (`GEMM-AFP4WFP4` →
  `gemm_afp4wfp4`, see `config_utils._dtype_dir()`). New config names must
  stay distinct under that fold — `GEMM-FOO-BAR` and `GEMM-FOO_BAR` collide.
- Files inside `configs/<arch>/...` carry **no arch prefix**; the default file
  is named exactly `DEFAULT.json`.
- A required `DEFAULT.json` that is missing raises naming that exact path.
  There is no probe to fall through, so a misplaced file surfaces as an error
  instead of silently resolving somewhere else.
- Moves and renames go in a pure `git mv` commit (100% rename similarity),
  with content changes in a follow-up.
- `kpack` is deprecated on CDNA4: the Triton AMD backend warns and
  force-overrides `kpack = 1` on gfx950, and the parameter is slated for
  removal. No gfx950 config carries it and none should; gfx942 configs still
  may. Existing `kpack` entries in the RDNA trees predate the rule — do not
  add new ones.

All of it is built by one function in `utils/config_utils.py`:

```python
resolve_config_dir(op, config_name, backend="triton", arch=None) -> str
```

It **builds** the path — no probing, no candidate list, no cross-backend or
cross-arch search — and validates every argument against a whitelist, so a bad
value fails closed with an `AssertionError` rather than resolving to an
escaped or wrong directory. `backend` is declared by the caller (gluon kernels
and gluon dispatch paths pass `"gluon"`; everything else takes the `"triton"`
default), because the two backends take disjoint config params and borrowing
across them would be a bug. `arch=` overrides the running architecture only
for documented compatibility fallbacks: MHC retries gfx942, and the Triton
`fused_clamp_act_mul` path retries its legacy gfx950 table.

`config_utils.py` is the shared core; each family keeps its own small loader
module on top of it, and every function has exactly one home:

| Module | Entry points |
| ------ | ------------ |
| `utils/config_utils.py` | `resolve_config_dir`, `load_config_json`, `select_leq_config`, path constants |
| `utils/gemm_config_utils.py` | `get_gemm_config`, `compute_splitk_params`, `add_default_gemm_config_params`, `pick_gemm_num_stages` |
| `utils/conv_config_utils.py` | `get_conv_config` + the shape-key formatters and table probes |
| `utils/mhc_config_utils.py` | `get_mhc_config`, `get_mhc_post_config` |
| `utils/moe_config_utils.py` | `get_moe_dispatch` — the only MOE config fetcher |
| `utils/tuned_config_utils.py` | `get_tuned_kernel_config` |

Attention and GMM kernels read their single `DEFAULT.json` straight off the
core (`resolve_config_dir()` + `load_config_json()`); a family module earns
its place once a family grows real selection logic.

### How GEMM configs resolve — `get_gemm_config()`

All GEMM-family kernels load configs through one function,
`utils/gemm_config_utils.py::get_gemm_config(config_name, M, N=None, K=None,
bounds=None, specialized_filename=None, backend="triton", B=None)`. It reads
`<arch>/<backend>/gemm/<d_type>/DEFAULT.json` (required), overlays a
specialized file when one matches, and returns `(config, is_tuned)`:

- the config is a fresh deep copy, safe to mutate;
- `is_tuned` is `True` only when a specialized (`N=…-K=…`, `B=…-N=…-K=…`, or
  `specialized_filename`) file was hit. `_get_config()` passes the pair
  through unchanged; the flag is there so callers and tuning tooling can
  detect shapes running on untuned defaults (call sites that don't need it
  may ignore it).

The per-kernel `_get_config()` must stay a thin wrapper:

```python
def _get_config(M: int, N: int, K: int):
    return get_gemm_config("GEMM-A16W16", M, N, K)

# Split-K kernels:
def _get_config(M: int, N: int, K: int):
    config, is_tuned = get_gemm_config("GEMM-A16W16", M, N, K)
    return compute_splitk_params(config, K), is_tuned
```

A kernel-level `_get_config()` that takes a `backend` argument defaults it to
`"triton"`, never to `None` — `None` is not a backend and the resolver rejects
it. Public wrappers that expose `backend: str | None = None` normalize it
(typically `"gluon"` on gfx1250, `"triton"` elsewhere) before calling down.

Split-K kernels also share one common second-stage reduce —
`_gemm_splitk_reduce_kernel` (and `_batched_gemm_splitk_reduce_kernel`) in
`_triton_kernels/common/splitk_reduce.py` — rather than carrying a per-kernel
reduce stage, regardless of whether the first-stage kernel uses Triton or
Gluon. New split-K kernels import it from there.

### Config JSON format

```json
{
  "M_LEQ_64":   { "...": "..." },
  "M_GEQ_4096": { "...": "..." },
  "any":        { "...": "..." }
}
```

- `M_LEQ_x` keys are searched ascending over
  `STANDARD_M_BOUNDS = (1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192)`,
  then `M_GEQ_x` descending, then `any`. Custom `bounds=(...)` must be strictly
  increasing positive ints.
- `any` must exist unless every reachable `M` hits an explicit bound — a
  `KeyError` at lookup time usually means it's missing.
- The old `{"small": ..., "large": ...}` shape is **banned**.
- Each `M_*` entry carries at minimum: `BLOCK_SIZE_M`, `BLOCK_SIZE_N`,
  `BLOCK_SIZE_K`, `GROUP_SIZE_M`, `num_warps`, `num_stages`, `waves_per_eu`,
  `matrix_instr_nonkdim`, `cache_modifier`, `NUM_KSPLIT`.
  (`add_default_gemm_config_params()` backfills `NUM_KSPLIT`/`cache_modifier`
  as a last resort; that is not a license to omit keys.)

### Tuning values live in JSON, never in Python

No `setdefault(...)` blocks, no inline config dict literals, no
arch-conditional constants, no hardcoded fallback configs in `.py` files. If a
value is missing at runtime, the fix is in the JSON. The MOE a8w4 triton
dispatch still ends in a Python default after its tuned lookup and its
same-`(N, K)` proxy — that last tier shrinks as coverage grows; do not add
more like it.

### Loading is unified — `load_config_json()`

Every config-file read goes through
`utils/config_utils.py::load_config_json(fpath, required=...)`.
`required=True` (the default) raises `FileNotFoundError` naming the exact
nested path; `required=False` returns `None` for genuinely optional tables and
the caller handles it. It is cached per path **including negative results**: a
config file added at runtime is not picked up without
`load_config_json.cache_clear()` or a process restart. The dict it returns is
the shared cached object — copy before mutating (the family loaders already do
this for their callers).

Do not hand-roll `json.load(open(...))` or function-attribute caches, and
prefer the family loaders over hand-built
`f"{AITER_TRITON_CONFIGS_PATH}/..."` paths — a hand-built path is a second
place the layout is encoded, and it goes stale silently.

Flat dispatch tables whose keys mean “value less than or equal to this upper
bound” use `select_leq_config(configs, value, prefix="N_LEQ_")`. It selects
the smallest matching numeric bound and falls back to `any`, returning a copy
that the caller may consume. Do not duplicate this selection loop in wrappers.

Kernels that carry a Python autotune search space (opt-in tuning) pin their
single default tile per arch via
`utils/tuned_config_utils.py::get_tuned_kernel_config(op, config_name,
kernel_name, fallback, backend)`, which reads the nested-layout
`DEFAULT.json`. The `fallback` must be launchable on any arch, not fast on one.

### Autotune search spaces — `autotune_configs()`

Every `@triton.autotune` takes its config list from
`utils/tuned_config_utils.py::autotune_configs(family, configs,
default_config=None, env=None, default="0")`. Never hand it a raw list:

```python
@triton.autotune(
    configs=autotune_configs("MY_FAMILY", _get_autotune_configs()),
    key=[...],
)
```

It returns every candidate while `<FAMILY>_TRITON_AUTOTUNE=1`, and exactly one
config otherwise, so nothing benchmarks at launch. A raw list searches on every
new key: it costs compile time, breaks CUDA-graph capture, and leaves a unit
test's numerics dependent on whichever config the timing happened to pick that
run. Which one gets pinned is `configs[0]` unless `default_config=` says
otherwise, and that default should come from `get_tuned_kernel_config` so
retuning it is a JSON edit rather than a code change.

`env=` names the variable for a family that published its own before this
convention existed, and `default=` is what an unset variable means for it —
together they let such a family route through this helper without changing what
it did before. `flash_attn_triton_amd/` uses both, for
`FLASH_ATTENTION_TRITON_AMD_AUTOTUNE`, which is on by default where every other
family is off. This covers the kernel that applies `triton.autotune()` as a call
rather than a decorator too (`_triton_kernels/fusions/attn_res.py`, behind
`ATTN_RES_TRITON_AUTOTUNE=1`) — a grep for the decorator misses that one.

A candidate list published in the config JSON is a **search space**, not a
launch-time list: handed straight to `@triton.autotune` it still benchmarks
every entry on every new key. It goes to `configs`, and `default_config=` pins
what launches — `chunk_delta_attn/flash_kda.py` reads its six K2 candidates
through `chunk_delta_attn_tuned_config_shortlist` and pins
`_K2_FALLBACK_CONFIG`. There are no exemptions: all 41 `@triton.autotune` sites
under `aiter/ops/triton/` go through the helper.

One consequence to know when reading the tuner: Triton consults its autotune
cache only when the config list holds more than one entry (`autotuner.py:235`);
with one config it takes `configs[0]` and never reads the `key`. A test about
the `key` therefore has to hand the autotuner a config space first — see
`test_tuner_keeps_the_two_schedules_apart`.

The unit tests do not rely on any of it: `op_tests/triton_tests/__init__.py`
pins one config per kernel for the whole suite, so a test's numerics never
depend on a benchmark.

### Config naming

| Kind             | Pattern                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic GEMM       | `GEMM-A{x}W{y}` (+ variants `_BLOCKSCALE`, `_PRESHUFFLED`, ...) |
| Batched GEMM     | `BATCHED_GEMM-A{x}W{y}`, specialized `-B={B}-N={N}-K={K}`       |
| Fused ops        | `FUSED-GEMM-{operation}`                                        |
| Feed-forward     | `FF-A{x}W{y}-fused`                                             |
| MOE              | `A8W4`, `A4W4` — dispatch tables, one `DEFAULT.json` per backend |

- **`K` in AFP4WFP4 filenames is the logical K, i.e. `2 * K_bytes`** — the
  wrapper doubles K before calling `get_gemm_config`. Tuning output named by
  the packed byte width will never be found.
- MOE dispatch tables are keyed `bm<block_m>_n<N>_k<K>` on the triton path and
  `bm<block_m>_n<N>_k<K>_<bucket>` (plus a `bm<block_m>_any` tier) on the
  gluon path — a different scheme per backend, which is why `backend` is a
  caller-declared argument. Never mix a MOE dispatch key with the GEMM
  `M_LEQ_x`/`M_GEQ_y` scheme in either direction.
- `configs/gemm/aot/` and `configs/paged_mqa_logits/aot/` are runtime AOT
  caches, not tuning configs — never check them in or migrate them.

For adding a config, seeding a new arch, and the per-family key schemes, follow
`configs/CLAUDE.md` (§5 and §6). For the manual tuning flow, see
`utils/_triton/tuning/README.md`.

## Config-aware kernel names in traces (`kernel_repr`)

Kernel names in traces embed the compile-time config so a trace row can be
matched to the exact tuned config
(`utils/_triton/kernel_repr.py::make_kernel_repr`):

```python
_gemm_a16w16_repr = make_kernel_repr(
    "_gemm_a16w16_kernel",
    ["BLOCK_SIZE_M", "BLOCK_SIZE_N", "BLOCK_SIZE_K", "GROUP_SIZE_M", "NUM_KSPLIT"],
)

# Triton entry kernel
@triton.jit(repr=_gemm_a16w16_repr)
def _gemm_a16w16_kernel(...):
    ...

# Gluon uses the same make_kernel_repr callback:
@gluon.jit(repr=_gemm_a16w16_repr)
def _gemm_a16w16_gluon_kernel(...):
    ...
```

Values are read from `specialization.constants` and sanitized (`None → NONE`,
bools → `0/1`, strings uppercased with non-alphanumerics folded to `_`).
**Every new launchable Triton or Gluon kernel gets a `repr=`** containing its
meaningful compile-time/tuned config keys. JIT-decorated device helpers that
cannot be launched independently do not require their own `repr`.

---

## Weight & scale shuffling — one home: `utils/shuffle.py`

All pre-shuffle/layout-permute helpers for weights and scales were unified
into `aiter/ops/triton/utils/shuffle.py`. Kernel
wrappers, Gluon paths, tests, and benchmarks import from there — the
per-kernel copies that used to live in `moe_op_gemm_*.py` and test files were
deleted. **Do not re-implement a shuffle** (the telltale is a local
`view → permute → contiguous` helper); if a new layout is needed, add it here.

| Function                 | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shuffle_weight(x, ...)` | Arch-aware weight preshuffle: gfx1250 WMMA/TDM path, otherwise delegates to `aiter.ops.shuffle.shuffle_weight` |
| `moe_weight_decode_view(w)` | Zero-copy `(E, N, K)` → decode view sharing storage (renamed from `moe_weight_gfx1250_decode_view`) |
| `shuffle_scale_gemm` / `unshuffle_scale_gemm` | GEMM MX-scale tiles — gfx950 `(32, 8)`, gfx1250 `(16, 4)` |
| `shuffle_scale_moe`      | MoE MX scales (a8w4/a8w8/a16w4/a4w4); `return_layout=True` also returns the `SWIZZLE_MX_SCALE` label (`CDNA4_SCALE`/`GFX1250_SCALE`); no-op on arches without a native layout (e.g. gfx942) |
| `shuffle_scale_batched`  | FP4 blockscale16 batched scales, arch-independent                        |

Callers should stay arch-agnostic: pass `arch=None` and let `get_arch()`
decide, and use `return_layout=True` instead of hardcoding swizzle labels.

---

## Architecture naming

Key behavior off GPU architecture identifiers, never product names — in
directory names (`configs/gfx950/...`) and in code:

```python
DEVICE_ARCH = arch_info.get_arch()

if DEVICE_ARCH in ("gfx950", "gfx1250"):   # correct
    ...
# Never: parsing "MI300"/"MI350" product strings or comparing chip numbers.
```

---

## Docstrings

Every public wrapper carries a docstring stating what the kernel computes, the
args (including which config parameters apply and what they control), the
return value, and any special considerations (unsupported options, layout
expectations such as "weights must be pre-shuffled", etc.).

---

## Logging

Use the aiter logger, not `print`, and pass the values rather than formatting
them into the message:

```python
from aiter import logger

logger.info("resolved config for M=%d N=%d: %s", M, N, config)   # lazy
# not: logger.info(f"resolved config for M={M} N={N}: {config}") # built every call
```

An f-string is evaluated before the level check, so it costs a full format on
every call even when the record is below the configured level — and for a
kernel wrapper that can mean formatting a tensor repr per launch. Match the
placeholder to the value: `%d` for counts and dimensions, `%f` for thresholds
and real scalars, `%s` for tensors, `torch.Size` shapes, tuples and strings.
`%d` or `%f` on `None` raises when the record is emitted, which logging
reports as `--- Logging error ---` on stderr instead of raising, so use `%s`
for anything optional:

```python
logger.info("%s", 1.0)    # ok
logger.info("%s", None)   # ok
logger.info("%f", 1.0)    # ok
logger.info("%f", None)   # TypeError: must be real number, not NoneType
```

The signature is the thing to check: a parameter annotated `float | None` or
`int | None` takes `%s` even where the call site happens to have resolved it.

An exception is not an argument to format. `logging` renders the traceback
itself, so pass `exc_info=True` rather than `%s`-ing the caught object.
`AiterTritonLogger` forwards only `*args`, so reach the stdlib logger for that:

```python
except Exception:
    logger.warning("config parse error", exc_info=True)                 # aiter.logger
    _LOGGER.get_logger().warning("config parse error", exc_info=True)   # AiterTritonLogger
```

Gate verbose output with `logger.debug(...)`, not with an `if` around the
call; `AITER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` turns it on, and `aiter/__init__.py` applies
that to the logger and its handler together. Never lower the level by hand
after import (`logger.setLevel(...)` leaves the handler where it was) and
never call `logging.basicConfig(...)` from library code.

## Tests

Tests live under `op_tests/triton_tests/<category>/`, mirroring this
directory's categories:

```bash
pytest op_tests/triton_tests/              # everything
pytest op_tests/triton_tests/gemm/basic/   # one subset
```

## Checklist for a new kernel

- Reuse first: check `utils/`, `_triton_kernels/common/`, and existing
  kernels before writing new helpers — don't duplicate code that already
  exists in the tree.
- Wrapper in the right category folder; Triton kernel body under
  `_triton_kernels/` or Gluon kernel body under `_gluon_kernels/<arch>/` at
  the same category path, launched only through the wrapper. JIT-decorated
  device helpers may remain with the entry kernel they support. No new
  top-level flat files.
- `_get_config()` is a thin `get_gemm_config(...)` call; split-K goes through
  `compute_splitk_params()`. No tuning values in Python.
- Config JSON in the **nested layout** (`configs/<arch>/<backend>/<op>/<d_type>/`),
  `M_LEQ/M_GEQ/any` keys, all required params present.
- `make_kernel_repr(...)` + `@triton.jit(repr=...)` for Triton entry kernels,
  `@gluon.jit(repr=...)` for Gluon entry kernels.
- Weight/scale shuffling imported from `utils/shuffle.py`.
- Arch checks against `gfx*` identifiers.
- Wrapper docstring.
- Unit test under `op_tests/triton_tests/<category>/` and a benchmark script
  under `op_tests/op_benchmarks/triton/bench_<op>.py` — a kernel ships as
  kernel + wrapper + test + benchmark.
