        k[t, h] = rope(rmsnorm(k[t, h], k_weight), cos_sin_cache[t])

    Written for diffusion transformers, where the rotated subspace is a
    fraction of the head that is neither the whole head nor half of it -- 96 of
    128 for MiniMax-H3 -- which the existing rope ops do not cover, and where
    there is no KV cache to write through.

    Key parameters:
    - q, k: [T, H, D] contiguous, modified in place
    - q_weight, k_weight: [D] RMSNorm gains
    - cos_sin_cache: [T, R] with cos in the first R/2 columns and sin in the
      rest; R is the rotated width and must be even and <= D
    - eps: RMSNorm epsilon

    One program owns a token. A token's heads are contiguous, so the [H, D]
    tile is one coalesced run and the token's cos/sin row is read once for all
    heads -- unfused, that row is broadcast into a [T, H, D] temporary, and the
    rotation costs a negate and two concatenates on top.

    Returns:
