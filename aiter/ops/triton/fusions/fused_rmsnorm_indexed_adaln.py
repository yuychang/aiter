    """RMSNorm followed by a table-indexed affine modulation, in one pass.

        out[m] = rmsnorm(x[m], weight) * (1 + scale[indices[m]]) + shift[indices[m]]

    This is the adaptive-layernorm (AdaLN) step of a diffusion transformer.
    Every token carries an index into a small table of modulation vectors --
    one row per (modality, timestep) combination -- so the affine parameters
    vary per token while the table stays tiny.

    Key parameters:
    - x: [M, N] activations, contiguous
    - weight: [N] RMSNorm gain
    - shift, scale: [G, N] modulation table, one row per index value
    - indices: [M] int32/int64, one table row per token
    - eps: RMSNorm epsilon
    - out: optional [M, N] destination; allocated when omitted
    - round_intermediate: round to the output dtype at the points an unfused
      implementation would store, trading accuracy for comparability with it

    Doing the norm and the modulation together is what makes this worth a
    kernel: separately, the activation is written and re-read between them, and
    ``scale``/``shift`` are materialised at [M, N] by the gather. Fused, x is
    read once and out written once, and the table is read straight from cache.

    Returns:
    - out: [M, N], same dtype as x
