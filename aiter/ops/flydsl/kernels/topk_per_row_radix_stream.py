"""Per-row TopK for a large k: read the row once, sort only what survives.

A row of N fp32 scores, k in the hundreds to low thousands, N up to a million.
The selectors this replaces walk the row once per radix pass and once more to
scatter -- four trips to HBM for a row that is otherwise perfectly streamable.

Here the row is read once. An initial window fills a candidate buffer and a
radix select over it gives a threshold; after that an element is kept only if it
beats the threshold, which almost none do, and the buffer is re-selected only
when it fills. The selection work is therefore proportional to the candidates,
not to N.

The threshold is sound at every point: it is the worst element of the k held so
far, so anything below it already has k better elements and cannot enter the
answer. It is a (key, column) pair rather than a key, because the answer is
defined to a finer order than the key alone -- see below.

The select is three radix passes of 11 / 11 / 10 bits on an order-preserving
32-bit key.

The answer is the k largest ordered by (value descending, column ascending),
which makes it a function of the input alone: identical across runs, and also
across block width, LDS budget and occupancy. That matters because those are
tuning knobs, and an answer that moved when they were turned would make a
retune a silent behaviour change.

Ties are what that order is for, and they cost nothing until they bite. When
more candidates share the cut value than there are places left, a second select
over ~column picks the smallest columns; columns are unique, so it lands on
exactly the right number and needs no tie rule of its own. On continuous input
the cut value occurs once, the branch is not taken, and the whole guarantee is
free. The alternative -- deterministic placement by prefix sum, as DeepSelect
does -- is reproducible but not canonical, since the answer it reproduces is
still a function of the thread geometry that placed it.

Output order is unspecified, matching ``torch.topk(sorted=False)``: the winners'
slots come from a shared counter. Only the set is canonical.

A row is one workgroup, which is the right shape only while there are enough
rows to fill the machine. Below that the `partial` mode splits one row across G
workgroups, each selecting its own slice; the survivors are then re-selected by
the same kernel in its ordinary mode, over a [rows, G*k] array of values. G
balances the two halves -- the slices run in parallel, the merge does not -- so
N/G = G*k, i.e. G = sqrt(N/k), which lands at 4..64 over the shapes here and is
the same order as the cluster size DeepSelect fixes at 16.

`partial` writes the winning values rather than their keys so that the merge is
an ordinary fp32 selection; it re-reads each winner from the row to get that
value, which is k gathered loads against a slice of N/G.
