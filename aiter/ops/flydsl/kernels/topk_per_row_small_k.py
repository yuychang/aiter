"""Per-row TopK for a small k, by narrowing to k chunks instead of sorting.

The rows this serves are short and wide-ish: a block-sparse indexer scores one
value per KV block, so even a 1M-token context is 8192 scores, and k is 16.
Sorting every tile of such a row costs 13-20x a pass that only reads it.

The narrowing:

    Partition the row into C >= k chunks and rank the chunks by their maximum,
    ties broken by chunk id. Every element of the row's true top-k lives in one
    of the top-k chunks.

    Why: let W be the chunks holding a true top-k element, so |W| <= k. Each
    chunk in W has a maximum >= v_k, the row's k-th largest. Every chunk outside
    W holds only elements < v_k, so its maximum is strictly below every maximum
    in W -- no tie can straddle the boundary, and W is inside the top-k chunks
    under any consistent tie-break.

    The k-th largest chunk maximum is therefore also a threshold no winner can
    fall below, and applying both -- chosen chunk AND above the cut -- is what
    makes the survivor set small as well as bounded.

A chunk is one lane's share of the row, so C is the wave width and the whole
selection is a ballot: no barrier, and the chunk maxima never leave registers.
Lane-strided, not sliced -- a slice would leave a short row inside fewer than k
chunks and collapse the cut. Measured survivors at k=16 over 1024- and 8192-wide
rows: 21-28 (gaussian, position-biased, heavily tied), 61 for a strictly
ascending row, 18-20 once truncated to a few hundred live columns. The buffer is
sized by the hard bound, k * elements-per-chunk.

Ties resolve toward the larger column, matching the Triton selector this
replaces: equal scores are common (a block score is a max over 128 keys from a
low-mantissa cache) and that is the order attention accumulates in.
