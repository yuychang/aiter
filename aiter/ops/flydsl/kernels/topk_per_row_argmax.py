"""Per-row argmax: k=1, as a reduction rather than a selection.

At k=1 the other selectors do work that has no answer to produce. The small-k
one ranks chunks by their maximum to bound a survivor set -- but the top-1 chunk
is just the chunk holding the maximum, and the survivors are whatever ties with
it; the radix ones walk the key space for a threshold that is the answer itself.
Measured against `torch.argmax`, which is the reduction this should have been,
the small-k selector is 1.3x behind at 50 rows of 129280 and 12x at 1024 rows of
262144.

A row is split across `splits` workgroups, not held by one. That is the whole
point of the shape this serves: one workgroup per row leaves a 50-row call using
a fifth of the machine, and both `torch.argmax` and the selectors it beats are
stuck at the same ceiling -- 0.65-0.86 TB/s against the 5.7 the same reduction
reaches once there are enough rows to fill the GPU.

The answer is the largest score, ties going to the smallest column, which is
what `torch.argmax` returns and the order `topk_per_row_decode` and the
streaming selector already promise. NaN outranks +inf, as everywhere else here.

Each thread scans its own columns in increasing order, so a strict `>` already
keeps the earliest of a tie without a column test; only the cross-thread fold
needs one, and that is log(block) comparisons, not one per element.
