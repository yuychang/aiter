# AITER Triton ops — PR review rules

When a change violates one of these rules, flag it and point the author to the
relevant rule — reviewers may not know these conventions yet.

## PR scope — one concern per PR

- **A new kernel goes in its own PR.** Flag any PR that adds a new kernel
  together with unrelated work — a refactor, a cleanup, config retuning, or a
  fix to a different kernel — and ask for the new kernel to be split into a
  dedicated PR. A new kernel's own PR still carries its wrapper, unit test and
  benchmark (see *Tests and benchmarks*); those belong to the kernel and are
  not separate concerns.
- **One kernel backend per PR.** Flag a PR whose changed files belong to more
  than one backend -- Triton/Gluon (`aiter/ops/triton/`, `aiter/aot/triton/`;
  Triton and Gluon are one backend, so a PR mixing the two is fine), HIP
  (`csrc/`), ASM (`hsa/`, `*_asm.py`), CK (`csrc/ck_*`, `ck_tile`), OPUS
  (`aiter/ops/opus/`), FlyDSL (`aiter/ops/flydsl/`, `aiter/aot/flydsl/`) --
  and list the files of the other backend, so the author knows what to move.
  Ask for one PR per backend. When the parts depend on each other, suggest
  stacked pull requests (the second PR based on the first one's branch and
  targeting it instead of `main`) rather than one combined PR. Tests and
  benchmarks belong to the backend they exercise; wrappers outside those
  paths, docs and CI files do not count as a backend.
- Keep PRs small and easy to review: one concern each, as granular as the
  change allows. Flag a PR that solves two or three independent problems at
  once — a bug fix plus a refactor, a new op plus a cleanup, retuning plus an
  API change — even when every individual change is correct.
- When flagging scope, name the specific part that should move out and say it
  belongs in a follow-up PR, so the author knows what to split rather than
  only that the PR is too large.

## Reuse before adding

Always prefer reusing existing code over adding new code. Before a PR adds a
helper, kernel, or utility, the existing ones should have been checked:
`utils/` (`config_utils` and the per-family `*_config_utils` loaders,
shuffling, arch info, logging, `kernel_repr`), `_triton_kernels/common/`
(shared split-K reduce), and existing kernels and test helpers. Flag new code
that duplicates functionality already in the tree, even partially — the fix is
to extend or import the existing implementation, not to add a parallel copy.

`utils/` is layered on purpose: `config_utils.py` holds the shared core
(`resolve_config_dir`, `load_config_json`, `select_leq_config`, the path
constants) and each family keeps its own loader module (`gemm_config_utils`,
`conv_config_utils`, `mhc_config_utils`, `moe_config_utils`,
`tuned_config_utils`) on top of it.
Flag a function given a second home — a re-export, a wrapper that only
forwards to another module, or a copy of a core helper inside a family module.

## Folder structure and imports

The layout is: public wrapper modules in category folders
(`gemm/{basic,batched,feed_forward,fused}/`, `attention/`, `moe/`,
`normalization/`, `quant/`, `rope/`, `fusions/`, `comms/`, `conv/`,
`gated_delta_net/`, `kimi_delta_attn/`, `gluon/`), kernel bodies under
`_triton_kernels/` at the same relative category path, or under
`_gluon_kernels/<arch>/` at the same relative category path when the Gluon
implementation is architecture-specific. Shared machinery lives in `utils/`
and tuned JSON in `configs/`. Flag:

- New modules added flat at the top of `aiter/ops/triton/` — every new
  wrapper goes in the correct category folder.
- New launchable `@triton.jit` or `@gluon.jit` kernel bodies defined inside
  public wrapper modules — Triton bodies belong under `_triton_kernels/` and
  Gluon bodies under `_gluon_kernels/<arch>/`, mirroring the wrapper's
  category path. JIT-decorated device helpers that are called only from
  another kernel may remain with the entry kernel they support.
- Generic helpers (config loading, shuffling, arch detection, logging)
  re-implemented inside a kernel file instead of imported from `utils/`.
- New code importing via the legacy flat paths
  (`from aiter.ops.triton.gemm_a16w16 import ...`) — the categorized path is
  required; `_BACKWARD_COMPAT_MAP` exists only for old external callers.
- Relative imports (`from .foo import ...`, `from ..utils import ...`) —
  only absolute imports (`from aiter.ops.triton.<...> import ...`) are
  allowed.

## Framework portability — torch stays out of `utils/_triton/`

`utils/_triton/` and the config loaders are torch-free so the kernels and
their tuned configs can be imported by a framework that is not PyTorch
(JAX-Triton is the live case). Flag:

- `import torch`, `from torch import ...` or any `torch.` use added to a
  module under `utils/_triton/`. The torch-using half belongs in `utils/` —
  split the helper rather than duplicating it (`moe_common.py` already lives
  on both sides). `utils/_triton/tuning/` is exempt: standalone tuning
  harnesses, not importable library code.
- torch newly introduced into config resolution (`utils/config_utils.py` or a
  `*_config_utils.py` family module) — loading a tuned config must not
  require torch.
- A new kernel module under `_triton_kernels/` or `_gluon_kernels/` that
  imports torch, or a first torch import added to one that is currently
  torch-free. A jit body cannot call torch; what drags it in is host-side
  glue — `torch.Tensor` annotations, dtype constants, `torch.empty`
  allocations — and that belongs in the public wrapper. Kernel modules that
  already import torch are grandfathered.

## Tuned configs: JSON placement and naming

Every tuned config lives in one nested layout:
`configs/<arch>/<backend>/<op>/<d_type>/`, e.g.
`configs/gfx950/triton/gemm/gemm_afp4wfp4/DEFAULT.json`. `<op>` is `gemm`,
`moe`, `conv`, `mhc`, `attention`, `gmm` or `fusions`; `<d_type>` is
`config_name.lower().replace("-", "_")`. The flat arch-prefixed directories
and every fallback that reached them are gone. Flag:

- A config JSON added outside `configs/<arch>/<backend>/<op>/<d_type>/` — a
  re-created `configs/gemm/`, `configs/moe/` or `configs/conv/` directory, or
  a loose file at the top of `configs/`. Nothing resolves there any more.
- An arch prefix on a filename inside `configs/<arch>/...` (wrong:
  `configs/gfx950/triton/gemm/x/gfx950-GEMM-X.json`), or a default file named
  anything other than exactly `DEFAULT.json`.
- A specialized file added to a `<d_type>/` directory that contains no
  `DEFAULT.json`, for a family whose loader requires the default — the load
  raises for every shape, not just the unspecialized ones.
- A family's files split across two `<d_type>/` directories that differ only
  by the `_dtype_dir()` fold (`GEMM-FOO-BAR` and `GEMM-FOO_BAR` collide; two
  spellings of one family must not both exist).
- A config file that is both moved and content-edited in the same commit —
  moves must be pure `git mv` renames, content changes in a follow-up.
- A new `.gitkeep` under `configs/`. A `<d_type>/` directory is created
  populated; the few `.gitkeep` files left from the migration are inert
  leftovers, not placeholders to maintain.
- A new arch directory seeded from another arch without the copy being
  byte-identical and called out in the commit message. The one seeding rule in
  force is gfx950 → gfx1250, triton only — never into a gluon directory, never
  backwards into gfx950.
- `kpack` newly added to a gfx950 config. Triton's AMD backend deprecates
  `kpack` on CDNA4 — it warns and force-overrides `kpack = 1` there, and the
  parameter is slated for removal. The gfx950 tree is clean of it; gfx942 may
  still carry it, and existing RDNA (gfx1151/gfx1201/gfx1250) entries predate
  the rule, so flag additions rather than the entries already there.
- Checked-in files under `configs/gemm/aot/` or `configs/paged_mqa_logits/aot/`
  — these are runtime AOT caches, never committed.

## Tuned configs: JSON contents

Flag, inside GEMM-family config JSON:

- Top-level `"small"` / `"large"` keys — the required scheme is `M_LEQ_<x>` /
  `M_GEQ_<x>` / `"any"`.
- A new config file with no `"any"` entry (lookup raises `KeyError` for
  uncovered M unless every reachable M hits an explicit bound).
- Entries missing required params: `BLOCK_SIZE_M`, `BLOCK_SIZE_N`,
  `BLOCK_SIZE_K`, `GROUP_SIZE_M`, `num_warps`, `num_stages`, `waves_per_eu`,
  `matrix_instr_nonkdim`, `cache_modifier`, `NUM_KSPLIT`. (Loader backfill of
  `NUM_KSPLIT`/`cache_modifier` is a last resort, not a license to omit.)
- MOE dispatch keys (`bm<block_m>_n<N>_k<K>`) in a GEMM config or GEMM
  `M_LEQ_x`/`M_GEQ_y` keys in a MOE dispatch table — the schemes must not mix.
- For `*AFP4WFP4*` specialized filenames: `K` must be the logical K
  (`2 * K_bytes`) — the wrapper doubles K before lookup, so a file named by
  the packed byte width will never resolve.

And inside MOE dispatch tables:

- A newly tuned gluon dispatch shape that does not carry all six `m2bucket`
  suffixes (`tiny`, `small`, `medium`, `medium2`, `large`, `xlarge`) — a
  missing bucket falls through to `bm<block_m>_any` and silently loses that
  shape's tuning for that M range. (Existing entries are unevenly covered;
  flag new gaps, not the ones already shipped.)
- A gluon dispatch file with no `bm<block_m>_any` tier for a `block_m` it
  otherwise covers: that tier is the last resort for an unmeasured shape.
- A `BLOCK_SIZE_M` / `block_m` key inside a dispatch entry — `block_m` is the
  dispatch key (routing decides it), not a tunable.
- Triton-shaped entry keys (`BLOCK_SIZE_N`, `num_stages`, ...) in a gluon
  dispatch file or gluon-shaped keys (`block_n`, `num_buffers`,
  `persistent_iters`) in a triton one — the two paths read disjoint params.

## Python-side config hygiene

These rules apply equally to Triton and Gluon wrappers and kernels. Tuning
values for either backend live in JSON, never in Python. Flag:

- Hardcoded tuning values in `.py` files: `config.setdefault(...)` blocks,
  inline dict literals with `BLOCK_SIZE_*`/`num_warps`/`waves_per_eu` keys,
  arch-conditional tuning constants, or hardcoded fallback configs. The fix is
  always in the JSON file, not the Python.
- A kernel-level `_get_config()` whose `backend` parameter defaults to `None`
  (or any value outside `("triton", "gluon")`) — `None` is not a backend and
  `resolve_config_dir()` asserts on it, so the kernel raises the moment a
  caller omits the argument. Kernel-level helpers default to `"triton"`;
  public wrappers that expose `backend: str | None = None` must normalize it
  before calling down.
- A new or modified Triton or Gluon GEMM `_get_config()` that does anything
  beyond calling `get_gemm_config(...)` with the appropriate backend selection
  (plus `compute_splitk_params()` for split-K kernels), and that does not
  preserve the standardized `(config, is_tuned)` result:

  ```python
  # Correct — thin wrapper
  def _get_config(M: int, N: int, K: int):
      return get_gemm_config("GEMM-A16W16", M, N, K)
  ```

- A `_get_config()` that swallows the `is_tuned` flag: the standardized
  signature returns `(config, is_tuned)` straight from `get_gemm_config()`,
  so flag new or modified `_get_config()` implementations that return a bare
  config dict. Call sites may legitimately ignore the flag
  (`config, _ = _get_config(...)` is fine) — it exists so callers and tuning
  tooling can detect a shape resolving to the untuned default and log or
  re-tune.
- Raw config-file reads — `json.load(open(...))` or function-attribute caches
  like `_get_config._config_dict` — instead of
  `aiter.ops.triton.utils.config_utils.load_config_json` (which caches per
  path, including negative results) or a family loader. All hand-rolled
  loaders were deliberately removed; do not add them back.
- Mutating the dict returned by `load_config_json()` — it is the shared cached
  object. Copy first (`dict(...)` for flat entries, `copy.deepcopy` for nested
  ones); the family loaders already copy on the caller's behalf.
- New hand-built config paths (`f"{AITER_TRITON_CONFIGS_PATH}/..."`) where a
  family loader or `resolve_config_dir()` would work — a hand-built path is a
  second place the layout is encoded, and it skips the argument validation
  that makes a wrong value fail closed.
- A hand-written loop selecting the smallest matching `N_LEQ_*` (or another
  upper-bound prefix) entry — use `select_leq_config()` so threshold ordering,
  fallback, and copying semantics have one implementation.
- A second MOE config reader. `utils/moe_config_utils.py::get_moe_dispatch` is
  the only MOE fetcher; flag any new MOE path built by hand, any direct
  `load_config_json` on a `moe/` file, and any reintroduced per-wrapper MOE
  loader.
- A new arch- or backend-fallback chain inside a loader (try this arch, then
  that one; try triton, then gluon). Resolution is deterministic. The
  documented compatibility exceptions are MHC's gfx942 fallback and Triton
  `fused_clamp_act_mul`'s legacy gfx950 fallback; both use the `arch=` override
  instead of a probe.
- A raw config list handed to `@triton.autotune`. Route it through
  `autotune_configs` from `aiter.ops.triton.utils.tuned_config_utils`:

  ```python
  @triton.autotune(
      configs=autotune_configs("MY_FAMILY", _get_autotune_configs()),
      key=[...],
  )
  ```

  That returns every candidate only while `<FAMILY>_TRITON_AUTOTUNE=1`, and a
  single config otherwise, so nothing benchmarks at launch. A raw list searches
  on every new key: it costs compile time, breaks CUDA-graph capture, and leaves
  a unit test's numerics dependent on whichever config the timing happened to
  pick that run. Pass `default_config=` when the list's first entry is not the
  one to pin.

  A family that already published its own variable name keeps it by passing
  `env=` (and `default=` for what unset means), as `flash_attn_triton_amd/` does
  with `FLASH_ATTENTION_TRITON_AMD_AUTOTUNE` — it still goes through this helper.

  There are no exemptions. A candidate list read from the config JSON is a
  search space for a tuning build, not a launch-time list — handed to
  `@triton.autotune` it still benchmarks every entry on every new key. Pass it
  as `configs` and pin the launch with `default_config=`, as
  `chunk_delta_attn/flash_kda.py` does with its published K2 candidates.

## Weight & scale shuffling — must come from `utils/shuffle.py`

All weight/scale pre-shuffle helpers are unified in
`aiter/ops/triton/utils/shuffle.py`: `shuffle_weight`,
`moe_weight_decode_view`, `shuffle_scale_gemm`, `unshuffle_scale_gemm`,
`shuffle_scale_moe`, `shuffle_scale_batched`. Flag:

- Any new local re-implementation of a weight or scale shuffle in a kernel
  wrapper, kernel body, test, or benchmark — the telltale is a small helper
  doing `view(...) → permute(...) → contiguous()` on weights or scales.
  Per-kernel copies were deliberately deleted; new layouts belong in
  `utils/shuffle.py`.
- Use of the removed name `moe_weight_gfx1250_decode_view` — it was renamed
  to `moe_weight_decode_view`.
- Hardcoded `SWIZZLE_MX_SCALE` labels (`"CDNA4_SCALE"`, `"GFX1250_SCALE"`)
  next to a `shuffle_scale_moe` call — use
  `shuffle_scale_moe(..., return_layout=True)` so the caller stays
  arch-agnostic.

## Kernel conventions

- Every new launchable Triton or Gluon kernel must set a config-aware `repr`
  using `make_kernel_repr` from `aiter.ops.triton.utils._triton.kernel_repr`:

  ```python
  _kernel_repr = make_kernel_repr(
      "_kernel_name",
      ["BLOCK_SIZE_M", "BLOCK_SIZE_N", "num_warps"],
  )

  @triton.jit(repr=_kernel_repr)  # Triton entry kernel
  # or
  @gluon.jit(repr=_kernel_repr)   # Gluon entry kernel
  ```

  Flag every new launchable `@triton.jit` or `@gluon.jit` kernel without
  `repr=`. Include all meaningful compile-time/tuned config keys so trace
  names identify the specialization. JIT-decorated device helpers that cannot
  be launched independently do not require their own `repr`.
- Split-K GEMM implementations must use the shared second-stage reduce,
  regardless of whether the first-stage kernel uses Triton or Gluon —
  `_gemm_splitk_reduce_kernel` / `_batched_gemm_splitk_reduce_kernel` from
  `aiter/ops/triton/_triton_kernels/common/splitk_reduce.py`. Flag any new
  Triton or Gluon per-operation reduce kernel that duplicates it.
- Triton and Gluon kernel bodies are internal: they must be launched only
  from their public wrapper under `aiter/ops/triton/`. Flag any direct
  import or launch of a kernel from `_triton_kernels/` or `_gluon_kernels/`
  in tests, benchmarks, or code outside the wrapper layer — and flag new
  kernels that ship without a public wrapper.
- Arch handling: flag product names (`MI300`, `MI350`, `MI355`, ...) in
  identifiers, filenames, comments-as-logic, or any parsing of product
  strings. Compare architecture identifiers instead:

  ```python
  # Correct
  if DEVICE_ARCH in ("gfx950", "gfx1250"): ...
  # Wrong
  if int(DEVICE_ARCH.split("MI")[1]) >= 350: ...
  ```

- Device handling: allocate on the input's device, never a hardcoded
  `"cuda"`. `device="cuda"` resolves to the process's current default device,
  so a wrapper whose inputs live on `cuda:3` allocates its output or
  workspace on `cuda:0` — a cross-device error at best, the wrong GPU at
  worst. Flag new `device="cuda"`, `torch.device("cuda")` and `.cuda()` in
  wrappers and kernel launch code:

  ```python
  # Correct
  y = torch.empty(shape, dtype=x.dtype, device=x.device)
  # Wrong
  y = torch.empty(shape, dtype=x.dtype, device="cuda")
  ```

  Docstring examples and tests that build their own inputs may keep
  `device="cuda"`; the rule is about library code deriving the device from
  the tensors it was handed.
- Flag new public wrapper functions without a docstring covering: what the
  kernel computes, the arguments (including which config parameters apply),
  the return value, and special considerations (layout expectations,
  unsupported options).
- Keep comments and docstrings concise. Flag padded or hard-to-follow prose:
  multi-paragraph docstrings that restate the code, tutorial-style
  explanations of Triton basics, narration of what the next line does, or
  commented-out code left behind. A comment earns its place by explaining
  *why* — a non-obvious constraint, a layout requirement, an arch quirk.

## Tests and benchmarks

- Every new Triton or Gluon kernel must ship a unit test under
  `op_tests/triton_tests/<category>/`, mirroring the kernel's category (a new
  `gemm/basic/` kernel gets `op_tests/triton_tests/gemm/basic/test_<op>.py`).
  Flag PRs that add a kernel wrapper without adding or extending a matching
  test. Likewise flag a new kernel with no benchmark script — a kernel ships
  as kernel + wrapper + unit test + benchmark.
- Tests must follow the existing pattern: pytest-style `test_<op>.py` files
  inside the category folder, shared helpers in the existing
  `*_test_utils.py` / `utils/` modules. Flag tests added flat at the
  `op_tests/triton_tests/` root or as one-off scripts.
- No kernel tuning configs in test files: flag test code that hardcodes
  config dicts (`BLOCK_SIZE_*`, `num_warps`, `waves_per_eu`, ...) or passes
  literal `config=` overrides to a wrapper. Tests exercise the wrapper's own
  config resolution — tuning values live only in `configs/` JSON.
- Unit tests assert, they do not dump. Flag `print(...)` of tensors, shapes,
  or timings and any ad-hoc `if __name__ == "__main__"` reporting block in a
  test file: correctness is checked with asserts
  (`torch.testing.assert_close` and friends) so a regression fails the test
  instead of needing a human to read the log. Diagnostic output worth keeping
  goes through the logger, per the next two rules — not through `print`. A few
  older tests still print (`gemm/basic/test_gemm_a8wfp4.py`,
  `quant/test_quant.py`, `conv/_helpers.py`) — flag new dumps, not those.
- Log messages use lazy `%` placeholders, never f-strings. Flag
  `logger.info(f"...")` and `logger.info("..." + x)`: an f-string is built
  before the level check, so the message is formatted and thrown away on every
  call below the configured level. Pass the values instead —
  `logger.info("shape=%s", x.shape)` — and match the specifier to the value:
  `%d` for counts and dimensions, `%f` for thresholds and real scalars, `%s`
  for tensors, `torch.Size` shapes, tuples and strings. `%d` or `%f` on `None`
  or on a tuple raises *at log time*, and logging reports that as
  `--- Logging error ---` on stderr rather than failing the test, so flag a
  numeric specifier on a value that can be either.
- Failure diagnostics go at WARNING or ERROR, never INFO. Under pytest
  `op_tests/triton_tests/__init__.py` pins `AITER_LOG_LEVEL=WARNING`, so an
  INFO message is invisible in CI. Flag `logger.info(...)` that reports a
  mismatch, a NaN, a "FAILED", or the detail behind an assertion that is
  about to fire — converting a `print` of that kind to INFO deletes the only
  evidence a failing run leaves behind. Detail a reader needs in order to act
  belongs in the assertion message itself, where pytest always shows it.
- A test that logs its verdict instead of asserting it is broken, and the
  level change makes that visible. Flag any `if ok: log("pass") else:
  log("fail")` with no assert on the same condition: the test cannot fail.
- Debug output is gated by level, not by an `if` around the call, and not by
  a module constant. Flag `if DEBUG_MODE: logger.info(...)` and any new
  `DEBUG_MODE`-style flag: write `logger.debug(...)` and run with
  `AITER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`, which `aiter/__init__.py` applies to the logger
  *and* its console handler. Flag code that lowers the level by hand after
  import (`logger.setLevel(...)`) — it leaves the handler where it was, so
  the records never come out — and flag `logging.basicConfig(...)` in a test,
  which reconfigures the root logger for the whole process at import time.
- No autotuning in unit tests: flag `@triton.autotune`, an autotune config
  sweep, or a loop over tile sizes inside a test. Tests exercise the config
  the wrapper resolves for the shape; tuning belongs in the tuning scripts
  and benchmarks.
- Benchmarks live in `op_tests/op_benchmarks/triton/` as `bench_<op>.py`,
  structured like the existing files. The config and shuffle rules above
  apply to them too: no hardcoded tuning dicts, shuffles imported from
  `aiter.ops.triton.utils.shuffle`.

## Keeping this file and the README current

Any cleanup or refactor that changes a convention under `aiter/ops/triton/` —
renaming or moving a shared helper, changing the config layout or loader
behavior, reorganizing folders, unifying duplicated code — must update
`aiter/ops/triton/README.md` **and** this instructions file in the same PR.
Flag convention-changing PRs that leave either document stale.
